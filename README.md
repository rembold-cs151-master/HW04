# Problem Set 5

## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings for function details, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Code for Problem 1 should be done in the `Prob1.py` file already in the repository. I've already set up the basic function definition for you here, you just need to fill it in. And as usual, feel totally free to write an extra helper functions that you might want.
 - [ ] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the `Prob2.py` file already in the repository. Again, I've set up the basic function definitions for you, and you largely just need to fill them in.

#### Testing
Automated tests have been added from Problem 1 (Parts A and B) and Problem 2. Part C of Problem 1 is graphical and thus is difficult to write an autochecker for, so you'll have to judge and test that yourself.
