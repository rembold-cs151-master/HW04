# Homework 4
![](https://github.com/<user_info>/workflows/Autotesting/badge.svg)

Assignment Status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of February 21 at midnight 


## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings for Problem 3, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Your written work should be in the form of a pdf, and the pdf should be titled `HW4.pdf`. Use an app like Scannable or Genius Scan to convert your images to black and white to hugely cut down on the size of the created pdf. (I don't need 20+ megapixel images of your homework!)
 - [ ] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the `Prob2.py` file already in the repository. 
 - [ ] Code for Problem 4 should be done in the `Prob3.py` file already in the repository.

#### Testing
Automated tests will be present for Problem 2 and for small parts of Problem 3. Problem 3 is very open-ended, so it is difficult to auto-test much of it. Make sure you meet all the requirements!
