# Problem Set 4

Assignment Status: PENDING

_Please change the above to DONE when you finish and want the assignment to be graded!_

Due the night of March 7th at midnight.


## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings for function details, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Code for Problem 1 should be done in the `Prob1.py` file already in the repository. This file is left largely up to you in terms of how you want to organize your code and what functions you might like to write to achieve your goal.
 - [ ] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the `Prob2.py` file already in the repository. I've already set up the basic function definition for you here, you just need to fill it in. And as usual, feel totally free to write an extra helper functions that you might want.
 - [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in the `Prob3.py` file already in the repository. Again, I've set up the basic function definition for you, and you largely just need to fill it in.

#### Testing
Automated tests will be present for Problem 2 and Problem 3. Problem 1 is visual, and you should just ensure that your final product looks like the image provided in the pdf instructions.
