Due the night of October 11 at midnight.


## Instructions
The homework pdf has the basic instructions, and you should definitely read the docstrings for function details, but here are some additional guidelines:
 - [ ] Code for Problem 1 should be done in the `Prob1.py` file already in the repository. The basic scaffolding of the required functions is provided, but it is up to you what you put inside.
 - [ ] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the `Prob2.py` file already in the repository. I've already set up the basic function definition for you here, you just need to fill it in. And as usual, feel totally free to write an extra helper functions that you might want.
 - [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in the `Prob3.py` file already in the repository. Again, I've set up the basic function definition for you, and you largely just need to fill it in.

#### Testing
Automated tests will be present for all three problems, though from Problem 1 only the type of output from the `create_cube` function is being checked. The rest of Problem 1 is visual, and you should just ensure that your can create arbitrary patterns of cubes by moving the mouse around and clicking.
